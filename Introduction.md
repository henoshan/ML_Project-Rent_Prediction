# ML_Project-Rent_Prediction
Predictive Property Rent Estimation Machine Learning Model using Linear Regression

In this project, I leveraged machine learning techniques to develop a robust predictive model for property rent estimation. Using Linear Regression, I engineered and analyzed key features, including property size, number of bedrooms (BHK), and number of bathrooms, to build an accurate rent prediction system. I employed scikit-learn for model development and Matplotlib and Seaborn for comprehensive data visualization. This project demonstrates my expertise in predictive modeling, data analysis, and data visualization and sets the stage for future applications in real estate pricing prediction and data-driven decision-making.
